# PhisioManager

This is an application for optimizing queue times in Phisio

It is bring when going to th phisio and you have to wait because the queue of patients is not optimized. All patients have different treatements, and all have to pass for different machines (magnet therapy, infrared lamps,...) what if a app make a automatic queue considering the optimal order for all the patients, in order to saave time?? It would be nice right ?? :)
